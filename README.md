# Prediction of Credit Card Fraud
Overview
This project aims to predict credit card fraud transactions using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a dataset of credit card transactions and utilizes classification techniques to identify fraudulent transactions based on certain features such as transaction amount, user behavior, and more. The model predicts whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the data for better model performance.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost for classification.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance of the models.
Cross-Validation: Implemented to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
